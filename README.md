# sbox-citizen-warrior

Very early stages

I intend to add many sword fighting features and have a general combat system (with combos) for simple a top-down view game

Current stage includes a citizen model with an animgraph created from scratch to only support anims I need

So far I have basic walking/running anims synchronized with player movement + simple attacking

## movement
Got basic movement to work with the simplest animgraph I could build from scratch

##### final result + basic attack
