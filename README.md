# sbox-citizen-warrior

Very early stages
I intend to add many sword fighting features and have a general combat system (with combos) for simple a top-down view game

Current stage includes a citizen model with an animgraph created from scratch to only support anims I need
So far I have basic walking/running anims synchronized with player movement + simple attacking
